# HentaiBot
Well... a bot that checks HentaiHaven.org for new hentai and if it finds a new one, sends the info as a message to a Discord channel(s)

<b>This bot is no longer able to automatically check the website due to the website now being protected by an anti-bot program. The only way to get this to send out the new hentai now is to manually copy and paste the new source in every time you want to do it.</b>

Made the messages on discord look much prettier by sending them as embeds instead of just the raw link - this should make it more reliable as it manually links the picture instead of relying on Discord to find the thumbnail.

# Instructions:
1. Go to www.hentaihaven.org
2. Copy it's page source (right-click- > "View Page Source" -> Copy and Paste the text that shows up) into the "source.txt" file.
3. Make sure the "Channels" and "Token" section are filled out (You can get a token from the Discord website), don't bother with the "last_name" value
4. Open the "start.bat" file.
